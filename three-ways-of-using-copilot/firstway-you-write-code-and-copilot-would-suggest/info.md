# In this way developer/coder would start writing code and copilot in parallel would analyze the code 
# being written and analyze it and suggest what AI thinks about the code

# two main things to keep in mind
# 1. Give proper and meaningful names to the files, variables and functions
# 2. Be as descriptive as possible and share as much context as possible so that Copilot can suggest best code possible
